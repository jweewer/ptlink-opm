PTlink Open Proxy Monitor
INSTALL (based on PTlink6 INSTALL)
---------------------
This distribution uses gnu autoconf.

0.  Read the CHANGES file to find out about the exciting new features 
in this version.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure
As default ptopm will be installed to $HOME/ptopm to specify a different
  install directory use ./configure --prefix=path/to/install/dir

2.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file. 

3.  "make" should build ptopm.

4.  "make install" to install the server and tools in the path defined
in config.h.
Note: ptopm will kill the running ptopm if found
	  and launch the new one with the existing .dconf files.

5.
  Edit ptopm.dconf files on your ptopm directory
